**Overview and Purpose**
The final project was constructed to present an individual retirement calculator. A general question most individuals in the workforce have is "When can I retire?" The goal of this project is to help someone accurately answer this question. The predictive model is based on three data sets that are part of the overall retirment blueprint. They are the respective cost of living in each of the United States, overall countrywide inflation, and average life expectancy based on age and gender. The result is a calculator that is highly accurate in its ability to predict whether an individual is qualified for retirement. If the individual is not eligible for retirement, the calculator provides an estimate as to how much more would be needed to reach the threshold of retirement.
